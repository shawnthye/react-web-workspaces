# react-web-workspaces

#### Simply start `crete-react-app` by running
```
yarn start
```

### Building
Because we don't want to use create-react-app's `eject`, keep the create-react-app webpack as it is.

So after `/packages/*` modified, simply rum below from the root project, so create-react-app dev server will do hot reload. Cheers : )
```
yarn build
```
