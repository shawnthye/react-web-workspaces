# react-web-workspaces

#### Simply start `crete-react-app` by running
```
yarn start
```

### Building
To keep `zero-configuration` by [**create-react-app**](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) as it is for now, we don't want to use `eject` option.

So after `/packages/*` modified, simply rum below from the root project, so create-react-app dev server will do hot reload. Cheers : )
```
yarn build
```
